Userscript that improves calendar pages for QC Times and Rock Island Dispatch-Argus websites

Install with Greasemonkey or a compatible userscript manager.

## Reason for existence
On some newspapers' calendars, ongoing events are shown as a separate event for each day. Sometimes, events you're interested in are crowded out by ones you've either already been to or have no plans to attend in the first place.

## Install
You'll need Greasemonkey or a compatible userscript manager. For now, installation is manual.

## Usage
Move your mouse over an event's date box. A button will appear that lets you hide every event with that title.
